the pillars of object oriented programming language are:
encapsulation
inheritance
polymorpism
abstract class
encapsulartion:
-encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.for example,a capsule     which is mixed of several medicines.
-we can able to achieve through data security through encapsulation
-we can achieve data hiding.
-by using getters and setters we can make the data read only or write-only
-by using getters and setters we can have control over the data.
-other class cannot access directly.
read only-by getters method
getter and setter method must be declared as public.
write only -by setters method
